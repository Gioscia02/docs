You can play around with the HTTP endpoints directly on your installation, under [`localhost:1865/docs`](http://localhost:1865/docs).
You will find there most of the documentation you need, alongside code snippets in various languages.

Check out also the the community [client libraries](clients.md).

When you feel ready you can also create custom endpoints direclty in your plugins.
