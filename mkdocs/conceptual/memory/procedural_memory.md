# LTM - Procedural Memory

The *Procedural Memory* contains tools and knowledge on how to do things. It is stored in a vector memory collection together with `declarative` and `episodic` memories.

To dive into `procedural memory` and `tool docstrings` reference the [tool basics](../../quickstart/writing-tool.md) page.
