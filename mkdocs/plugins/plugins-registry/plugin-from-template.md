# &#128268; Using the Plugin Template

We have prepared a GitHub template for you to expedite the creation of a new plugin, ready for publication in the public Registry. The template includes a complete scaffolding for the plugin and the GitHub action configuration to release the plugin package.

## Creating the new plugin

In the example we will create a plugin for the Poetic Socks Seller (refer to the Quickstart section if you're not familiar with it). In the next steps, replace `poetic_sock_seller` with the name of you futuristic plugin!

Navigate to the [plugin-template](https://github.com/cheshire-cat-ai/plugin-template){:target="_blank"} GitHub repository, click on `Use this template` and, then, `Create a new repository`:

 as repository name and then click on `Create repository`:

## Cloning the Plugin

Now that you set up the remote repository on GitHub, you need to set up the code locally.
Hence, clone the repository directly in the Catâ€™s plugins folder on your machine:

``` shell
cd core/cat/plugins
git clone https://github.com/[your_account_name]/poetic_sock_seller.git
```

## Customizing the Plugin

Finally, run the setup.py script to customize the repository:

``` shell
cd poetic_sock_seller
python setup.py
```

The script will prompt you to write the name of your plugin, `Poetic Sock Seller`.
The output in the terminal should look like:

The template contains a source code example, look at it in the `poetic_sock_seller.py` file.

### &#128230; Release Creation

A repository created with our template automatically includes the creation of a release on GitHub through a GitHub action. This automation happens whenever you push changes to the `main` branch and the `version` number in the `plugin.json` file changes. The release is automatically tagged with the version number and released in all the formats supported by GitHub.

For details about the GitHub action, refer to the file `.github/workflows/main.yml`.
