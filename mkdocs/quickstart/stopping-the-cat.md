# &#128640; Stopping the Cat

## Stopping the Cat

When you're done using the Cat, stop the terminal by clicking on it and press `CTRL + c`. Then, run the command:

```bash
docker compose down
```

We want to remind you that Long-Term Memory is a locally persisted memory.
When you restart the Cat, all conversation history and uploaded documents will still be there.

## Next Step

Congratulations on completing the quickstart!  

We encourage you to explore the Cat further and try writing and publishing your own plugins to enhance your experience.
