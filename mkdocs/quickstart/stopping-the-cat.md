# &#128640; Stopping the Cat

## Stopping the Cat

When you're done using the Cat, simply use the `docker compose down` command to stop it.
When you restart the Cat, all conversation history, uploaded documents, and installed plugins, including your own, will still be there.

## Next Step

Congratulations on completing the quickstart!  

We encourage you to explore the Cat further and try writing and publishing your own plugins to enhance your experience.
